## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API key

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd medical-chatbot
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```powershell
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # PowerShell
# venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Command Prompt

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create environment file
Copy-Item .env.example .env  # PowerShell
# copy .env.example .env  # Command Prompt

# Edit .env and add your Google Gemini API key
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```powershell
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. Get Google Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key" 
4. Copy the generated API key
5. Open `backend\.env` in a text editor
6. Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=[Gemini Api Key]
   ```
6. Save the file

**Important**: Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control.

## Running the Application

### Quick Start (Recommended)
Use the provided startup scripts to run both servers:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
start-dev.bat
```

### Manual Start

#### Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd backend
python main.py
# Server will run on http://localhost:8000
```

#### Start Frontend Development Server
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Application will be available at http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:5174
```

### Access the Application
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:5174
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (FastAPI auto-generated docs)

## API Endpoints

### POST /chat
Main chat endpoint for medical assistance.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "I have a headache, what should I do?",
  "conversation_history": [],
  "session_id": "optional_session_id"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "For a headache, you can try these immediate relief steps..."
}
```

### GET /health
Health check endpoint for monitoring server status.

## Safety Features

### Built-in Safety Guardrails
- **No Diagnoses**: Never provides specific medical diagnoses
- **No Prescriptions**: Never recommends specific medications
- **Emergency Detection**: Recognizes emergency situations and advises calling 911
- **Limitation Awareness**: Clearly states when queries are outside scope
- **Professional Referral**: Encourages consulting healthcare providers when appropriate

### Emergency Response
The AI is programmed to immediately recommend emergency services for:
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe bleeding or trauma
- Loss of consciousness
- Signs of stroke or heart attack
- Suicidal thoughts or mental health crises
- Severe allergic reactions

## Development

### Frontend Development
- Uses Vite for fast development and hot reloading
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Modern React patterns with hooks and functional components

### Backend Development
- FastAPI provides automatic API documentation at `/docs`
- Pydantic models ensure data validation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- In-memory session storage for conversation context

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for frontend type safety
- Python type hints for backend
- Comprehensive error handling
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI functionality
- `HOST`: Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)

### Security Notes
- API keys should be stored securely in environment variables
- CORS is configured for development; adjust for production
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Contributing

When contributing to this project, please:
1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Ensure all safety guardrails remain in place
3. Test thoroughly with various medical scenarios
4. Update documentation for any new features
5. Prioritize user safety in all medical responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Frontend not loading or showing errors:**
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- Check that the backend is accessible at http://localhost:8000
- Try refreshing the browser or clearing cache

**Backend API errors:**
- Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly set in `backend\.env`
- Check that all Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure Python version is 3.8 or higher

**CORS errors:**
- The backend is configured for common development ports (5173, 5174)
- If using a different port, update the CORS origins in `backend\main.py`

**Port conflicts:**
- Frontend: Vite will automatically try different ports if 5173 is busy
- Backend: Change the port in `main.py` if 8000 is occupied

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output of both servers for error messages
2. Verify all installation steps were completed
3. Ensure your Google Gemini API key is valid and has proper permissions
4. Check the FastAPI documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs when the backend is running
